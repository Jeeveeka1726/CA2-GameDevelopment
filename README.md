TITLE : Doom's dash

Concepts used: HTML,CSS,JS(ES6 module)

Doom's dash is a fun  running and  game with animations. 
We can use the arrow keys to move the main character and use space button to activate the power up.
I have used sprite animations from the sprite sheet provided from the reference to create this game.

It's a fun game to play for all ages.
